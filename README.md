# MakeIt5
A new GUI based game, in which an AI is designed to make the most optimal moves in order to win the game. 
MakeIt 5, A new game which includes a 10x9 board. It requires two players to play with. Each player gets to put a coin in it. So if we put a coin on the top most row, in a specific column then it shall slide down to the lowest unoccupied slot in that column. The slot occupied by the coin, stays occupied. So whichever player gets 5 consecutive coins(their respective color coins only) either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, wins the game. The AI designed uses minimax function to compute the next steps optimally.
Player 1 is the human playing, and player 2 is the AI playing.
